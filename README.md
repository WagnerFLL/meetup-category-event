# Predicting meetup group category

This repository shows a data science pipeline to solve an Artificial Intelligence problem found on Kaggle:

* Predict the __category of a new group__ .

## Observations

1. _The problem description and my approach to solve this problem are documented and coded entirely on this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/francamacdowell/meetup-category-event/blob/master/Meetup%20event%20categorizer.ipynb)_.

2. _The dataset and the problem are both on Kaggle, more details and **links** in the Notebook_.

3. _The code on Jupyter Notebook isn't reproducible because the dataset data it's too large and I chose not to put it in github, but the link to it_.
